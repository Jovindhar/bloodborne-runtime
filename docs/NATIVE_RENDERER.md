# Native renderer (milestone R5)

[← Documentation](README.md)

**Goal:** the game's graphics drawn with each platform's own GPU API, with nothing translated
while the game runs: no MoltenVK on macOS, no shaders compiled during play. The renderer stays
multiplatform: one shared core, and thin backends for Vulkan (Linux, Windows) and Metal (macOS).
It is the graphics half of the native port; the CPU half is the
[recompiler](https://github.com/bloodborne-native/bloodborne-recomp/blob/main/docs/RECOMPILATION.md).

This page is the renderer's status and plan. The GPU interface it is built on is specified in
[Render adapter](RENDER_ADAPTER.md); what a frame costs is in [Performance](PERFORMANCE.md).

## Principles

1. **Multiplatform.** Nothing works on Metal only. Planning a frame, tracking resources and
   converting shaders happen in the shared core; a backend only speaks its API.
2. **Always playable.** Native Metal is the default on Apple Silicon; the MoltenVK renderer stays
   selectable (`BB_METAL_FRAME=0`) until N5 is accepted.
3. **Measured.** Each step is compared against the path it replaces in alternating runs: FPS,
   frame-time p90, CPU time, the GPU thread's time per draw, and GPU time from Metal System
   Traces.
4. **Ahead of time where possible.** Shaders and texture layouts converted once, on the player's
   machine, from their own copy of the game. No game code, shaders or assets in any repository.

## Progress

Each bar has 20 blocks, one per 5% of the step's accepted scope. R5 is the mean of its seven
steps.

| Step | Progress | State, and the next action |
|---|---|---|
| **R5 · native renderer** | 56% `███████████░░░░░░░░░` | N0, N1 and N4 done; N5 the default, waiting for acceptance; N6 next |
| N0 · scope | 100% `████████████████████` | Done: where the commands come from and where a frame's time goes |
| N1 · frame planning | 100% `████████████████████` | Done: clears deferred into the next pass's load action |
| N2 · shaders ahead of time | 0% `░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░` | After N6. First action: an inventory of the shader variants the game uses |
| N3 · textures as objects | 0% `░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░` | After N6. First action: trace where the engine creates and releases textures |
| N4 · render adapter | 100% `████████████████████` | Done: A0–A6; the renderer records through the [adapter](RENDER_ADAPTER.md) |
| N5 · Metal backend | 95% `███████████████████░` | M1–M4 implemented; native Metal the default since 0.9.0 RC 1. Next: acceptance (below) |
| N6 · engine render boundary | 0% `░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░` | Next. First action: the written plan in this document (below) |

## Now and next

In this order (the app's roadmap):

1. **N5 acceptance (now).** The maintainer's play sessions passed. Acceptance waits for:
   - players' reports on the 0.9.0 release candidates (RC 1: native Metal by default; RC 2:
     online and the save editor);
   - the start-up capability comparison on M1 and M2 Macs (`BB_METAL_CAPS=compare` logs every
     difference between the Metal backend's answers and MoltenVK's; `BB_METAL_CAPS=moltenvk`
     uses MoltenVK's). On the M3 Pro it finds 0 differences.

   Until then the app bundles MoltenVK and the Vulkan loader for the fallback only. After
   acceptance: decide whether the fallback leaves the macOS app.
2. **N6, the engine's render boundary (next).** The native renderer takes the engine's draws at
   CoreGraphics2's seven draw methods, with their draw state, instead of decoding the PS4 command
   buffers the game writes. R4 (bloodborne-recomp, done) named and described what it needs:
   [the annotations](https://github.com/bloodborne-native/bloodborne-recomp/blob/main/docs/RECOMPILATION.md#annotations)
   and `annotations/structs.h`. The first steps:
   1. Write the plan here: how a draw's state maps onto the adapter (the input-assembly, output
      merger and rasterizer blocks onto the pipeline description and `DrawState`; each stage's
      samplers, textures and constant buffers onto binding slots; the vertex buffers onto the
      vertex input); what keeps the packet path (render-target passes, compute passes,
      Scaleform: the other 15% of the draws) and how both paths stay ordered in one frame; and
      how the hook is reached from the recompiled library as well as from the translator.
   2. A first hook that only observes: the seven methods' draws counted and their state read,
      compared with what the packet reader decodes for the same draws, with nothing drawn
      differently.
   3. Then draws taken over one kind at a time, starting with the mesh draw (65% of the seven
      methods' calls), each measured against the packet path.
3. **The recompiler's CPU work** (bloodborne-recomp).
4. **N2 and N3.** Shaders are still recompiled from GCN and converted to MSL while the game runs
   (the Metal backend caches built pipelines between sessions); textures are still inferred from
   GPU memory by shadPS4's texture cache.

## What was measured

- **The command stream (N0).** Bloodborne links libGnm statically: the game writes the PS4's
  command packets (PM4) itself, through 99 known libGnm methods, and the packets record those
  calls without loss. Until N6, the packet reader is the front end.
- **A frame on MoltenVK (N0;** Hunter's Dream, about 48 FPS): 14.9 ms of GPU
  work and 5.9 ms of GPU idle (28% of the frame) in about 420 Metal encoders. Every clear,
  tessellated draw (MoltenVK runs the vertex and hull stages as a compute pass) and copy between
  draws ended a render pass. CPU: the game's code about 3.8 cores, the renderer about 1.2,
  MoltenVK and Metal about 0.6.
- **Frame planning (N1).** Eligible clears become the next pass's load action (on by default;
  `BB_DEFER_CLEARS=0` turns it off): +1–2 FPS. Drawing fixed-factor tessellation as triangles
  (`BB_FIXED_QUAD_TRIANGLES=1`) cost more CPU and p90 than it saved and stays opt-in; Metal's own
  tessellator does that work in the Metal backend. Grouping copies gained nothing.
- **The Metal backend (N5)**, M3 Pro, 1080p output:

  | Where, setting | Metal | MoltenVK |
  |---|---|---|
  | Cathedral Ward (the test save), native 1080p | 38.2–39.6 FPS | 30.6 FPS |
  | Hunter's Dream, FSR 3.1 Balanced (the Metal backend's first version, when it still offered FSR) | 65.5 and 61.7 FPS, p90 16.3 and 17.6 ms | 58.0 and 58.1 FPS, p90 20.4 and 18.9 ms |
  | A new game, 3 h 26 min of play by the maintainer, native 1080p | median 42.2 FPS, 37.2 or more 90% of the time, no faults | not measured |

  Every pipeline the game used in a long session builds in Metal (550: 510 graphics, 40 compute;
  0 failed), and no draw met a missing pipeline or an unsupported command. The GPU thread
  records a draw in about 4.0–4.4 µs on the Metal backend.
- **Upscalers on Metal.** At native 1080p no upscaler beats native: in Cathedral Ward native
  39.0 FPS, MetalFX Balanced 33.5, MetalFX Quality 31.7. At 1080p the frame is not bound by
  pixel work, so the upscaler is off by default.

## The engine's render boundary (for N6)

Dantelion2's CoreGraphics2 draws through seven methods of its graphics context (`draw`,
`drawInstanced`, `drawIndexed`, `drawIndexedInstanced`, `drawIndirect`, `drawIndexedIndirect`,
`dispatch`). Each applies the state blocks of the draw state it is given, binds the shader
resources and calls libGnm. Counted with `BB_DRAW_CENSUS=1` (M3 Pro, translator, the player's
save in a level, 33 FPS: about 62,000 libGnm draws and dispatches a second, about 1,880 a frame):

| Through | Share of libGnm's draws and dispatches |
|---|---:|
| The seven methods (`drawIndexed` 33,000 a second, `draw` 17,800, `drawIndexedInstanced` 1,800, `drawIndirect` 100) | 85% |
| CoreGraphics2's compute passes: buffer copies and fills, texture clears and copies, on the same context and resource binder | 7% |
| Render-target passes (fast-clear elimination, depth-stencil clears, depth decompression) | 2% |
| Scaleform's renderer (menus and HUD) and one small wrapper outside CoreGraphics2 | 6% |

The compute passes make about 4,400 dispatches a second, which is nearly every dispatch: the
only others are the few the render-target passes make. `dispatch`, the seventh method, did not
run in the count.

So N6 can take nearly all of the world's draws at the seven methods; the compute passes, the
render-target passes and Scaleform are three smaller boundaries of their own.

**Who calls the seven methods** (the 16 busiest call sites): 65% of the calls come from
CoreGraphics2's mesh draw (`CG::MeshRenderer::drawMesh`: one draw per face set of a mesh, with
the mesh's vertex buffers and input layout); then three functions with 18%, 7.5% and 5.9%. Every
mesh draw counted used one material class, which picks a shader program by technique and pass
type and binds its five stages' shaders, its constants (parameter objects writing its constant
buffer) and its textures (pixel stage, and domain stage for tessellation). The 18% and the 5.9%
are deferred lighting (batches of up to 12 lights drawn as full-screen quads limited by the
batch's depth bounds); the 7.5% draws geometry written into an upload ring.

**The draw state** is one object modelled on Direct3D 11: input assembly, 32 vertex buffers, the
rasterizer, blend and depth-stencil states, eight colour targets and a depth target, and five
graphics stages, each with 16 samplers, 128 textures and 14 constant buffers. Its known layout is
in bloodborne-recomp's `annotations/structs.h`.

## The Metal backend today (N5)

On Apple Silicon `run.sh` selects it (`BB_METAL_FRAME=1`, `BB_GFX_BACKEND=metal`) unless
`BB_METAL_FRAME=0` asks for MoltenVK; Rosetta and other Vulkan drivers (`BB_VK_DRIVER`) use
MoltenVK. Linux keeps the Vulkan backend.

- **Start-up without Vulkan.** The native path links and maps neither the Vulkan loader nor
  MoltenVK. The shared renderer still uses Vulkan's types and calls some Vulkan entry points
  (instance, device, queue, capabilities, object creation); the Metal backend answers them
  (`mtl_vk_layer`, decision 6 of the [adapter](RENDER_ADAPTER.md#decisions)). Capabilities come
  from a recorded profile plus the MTLDevice (`mtl_vk_caps`). A C entry-point bridge
  (`mtl_vk_c_bridge`) lets optional Vulkan upscaler libraries resolve without the loader.
- **Resources.** Buffers, images, views and samplers are Metal objects; the game's memory is used
  in place (`newBufferWithBytesNoCopy`); everything the GPU may touch is in a Metal residency set.
  No VMA allocator.
- **Commands.** The adapter's Metal recorder (`mtl_recorder`) encodes draws, dispatches, draw
  state, bindings, barriers, clears, blits and fills; what the shared code still records as
  Vulkan commands (the scheduler's passes, transfers) is encoded by the Metal frame
  (`mtl_frame`). Submissions are committed on the backend's own queue; timeline semaphores are
  Metal shared events, fences Metal completion.
- **Shaders and pipelines.** SPIR-V to MSL with SPIRV-Cross (direct buffer, texture and sampler
  slots); rect lists rewritten as triangles; tessellation as compute kernels plus Metal's
  tessellator; geometry shaders as kernels. Built pipeline states are kept in a Metal binary
  archive between sessions (`PipelineFactory`).
- **Presentation.** The frame is drawn letterboxed into the window's `CAMetalLayer` drawable,
  with the settings overlay and FPS counter drawn by Dear ImGui's Metal backend.
- **Upscaler.** MetalFX only, encoded on the frame's command buffer with the backend's own
  textures; a setting asking for FSR or DLSS runs MetalFX. FSR 3.1 and FSR 4.1.1 are offered only
  with the MoltenVK fallback. Off by default.
- **Diagnostics.** `BB_METAL_TRACE=1` (command counts), `BB_METAL_CAPS=compare|moltenvk`.

The shader compiler, shader rewrites, pipeline cache and format and state tables originated in
[Huax-1839/bloodborne-macos](https://github.com/Huax-1839/bloodborne-macos/commit/0f0cf54) and
reached this project through
[Wooloomooloo2/bloodborne_mac_port](https://github.com/Wooloomooloo2/bloodborne_mac_port)
(`0b50589`, `78b59f5`), which further developed the Metal command layer and frame encoder. The
first Metal frame intercepted the renderer's Vulkan calls; the adapter replaced that route.
Crashes and their fixes are in [Stability](STABILITY.md).
